### 🪟 Windows Setup

#### Option A: Direct Install

1. **Install Node.js 18+[Node.js 18 LTS (Recommended)]**
   - Download from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org),⚠️ Node 20 may cause native module issues.
Use Node 18 LTS for stability.
   - Run the installer — check "Automatically install necessary tools" when prompted
   - This installs Node.js, npm, and build tools (Python, Visual Studio Build Tools)

2. **Clone and run**
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/Ragul0812/CTF-PLATFORM.git
   ```
   ```cmd
   cd ctf-platform
   ```
   ```cmd
   npm install
   ```
   ```cmd
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser: **http://localhost:8080**

#### Option B: Using WSL (Recommended for Windows)

1. **Enable WSL**
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
   Restart your computer.

2. **Open Ubuntu from Start Menu**, then follow the Linux setup above.

#### Troubleshooting Windows Build Errors

If `npm install` fails on `better-sqlite3`:

```cmd
# Install Windows Build Tools (run as Administrator)
npm install -g windows-build-tools

# Then retry
npm install
```

If you still have issues:
```cmd
npm install --build-from-source better-sqlite3
```
